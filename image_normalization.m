function [pI, I] = image_normalization(I, background, minI, maxI, scaling)
% Removes background, normalizes image to a 0-255 and subtracts noise
%
% input variables:
%
%       I is a grayscale image frame.
%
%       background is the average frame that is substracted from each frame
%       to get rid of non moving particles and noise
%
%       maxV and minV are the maximum and minimum intensity values of the
%           video after substracting the background and adding the mean
%           limits of the de-backgrounded images for histogram equalization
%       scaling in pixels/Âµm
%
% output variables:
%
%       I is the normalized grayscale image.
%
% Called by particle_detection.m, threshold_level.m
%
% Requires: image processing toolbox
%
%   ex.:  I = image_normalization(I, background, minI, maxI, true)
