% Saves data in a mat file and in a csv file (or and excel file, if you

% video.
%
% input variables (optional):
%
%       fn = filename (optional)
%
%       threshold_length (optional) is the minimum length of the track to be
%           considered as such (default 2 seconds)
%
%       t (optional) is a cell array, in which every cell is a
%           MX2 matrix where M is the number of Frames that encodes a
%           particular track. The first column is the frame number, and the
%           second the particle ID in that given frame. N is the number of
%           frames of the track.
%
%       Centroids (optional) is a cell array of size (NumberofFramesX1), in
%           which each cell is a NX2 matrix, N being the number of
%           particles detected within the frame, and the 2 columns
%           represent position x and y in pixels of the centroids of the
%           particles.
% 
%       Geometries (optional) is a cell array of size (NumberofFramesX1),
%           in which each cell is a NX12 matrix, N being the number of
%           particles. Columns are area, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength,
%           eccentricity, equivDiameter, orientation, perimeter and
%           solidity of each particle as defined in function regionprops,
%           and arc_length, minimum distance between poles, width and
%           interior radius of curvature.
%
%       Scaling (optional) is pixel/ï¿½m
%
%       FrameRate (optional) is the video frame rate in frames/s
%
%
% Requires: image processing toolbox, parfor_progress
%
%
% Ex.: [tracks, good_tracks, track_lengths] =...
%     track_select(fn, threshold_length, t, centroids, geometries, scaling, FrameRate)
